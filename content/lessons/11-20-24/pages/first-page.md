> [!caution]- Why would we compare Jesus to a pelican?
> The pelican has been a symbol of Christ for centuries, especially in the Medieval Church. Legend says that in times of hardship, if food were scarce, the pelican would pierce its own side to feed its young with its blood, symbolizing Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
